// Day 15: Closures
// Task / Activities:

// Activity 1: Understanding Closures
// Task 1: Write a function that returns another, where the inner function accesses a variable from the outer function scope. Call the inner function and log the result.


// Task 2: Create a closure that maintains a private counter. Implement function to increment and get the current value of the counter.

// Activity 2: Practical Closures
// Task 3: Write a function that generates unique IDs. Use a closure to keep track of the last generated ID and increment it with each call.


// Task 4: Create a closure that captures a users name and returns a function that greets the user by name.

// Activity 3: Closures in Loops
// Task 5: Write a loop that creates an array of functios. Each function should log its index when called. Use a closure to ensure each function logs the correct index.

// Activity 4: Module Pattern
// Task 6: Use closure to create a simple module for managing a collection of items. Implement methods to add, remove, and list items.


// Activity 5 : Memoization
// Task 7: Write a function that memoizes the result of another function. Use a closure to store the results of previous computations.

// Task 8: Create a memoized version of a function that calculates the factorial of a Number.
