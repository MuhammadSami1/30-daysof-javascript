// Day 11: Promise and Async/Await
// Task / Activities:

// Activity 1 : Understanding Promise
// Task 1: Create a Promise that resolves with a message after a 2-second timeout and log the message to the console.

// Task 2: Create a Promise that rejects with an error message after a 2-seconde timeout and handle the error using .catch().

// Activity 2: Chainnig Promises
// Task 3: Create a sequence of Promise that simulate fetching data from server. Chain the Promise to log messages in a specific order.

// Activity 3: Using Async/Await
// Task 4: Write an async function that waits for a promise to resolve and the logs the resolved value.

// Task 5: Write an async function that handles a rejected promise using try-catch and logs the error message.

// Activity 4: Fetching Data from an API
// Task 6 : Use the fetch API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using promises.

// Task 7: Use the fetch API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using async/await.

// Activity 5: Concurrent Promises
// Task 8: Use promise.all to wait for multiple promises to resolve and then log all their values.

// Task 9: Use Promise.race to log the  value of the first promise that resolves among multiple promises.
